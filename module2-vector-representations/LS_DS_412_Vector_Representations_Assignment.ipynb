      "  The Nittany Artificial Intelligence (AI) Alliance at The Pennsylvania State University (PSU) is looking for a talented and highly motivated undergraduate intern to work on AI-related projects, gaining hands-on experience that enhances their learning at Penn State, while also gaining highly marketable development experience. Selected candidates will be members of a software development team and assist with the development of prototypes leveraging artificial intelligence and the design and configuration of cognitive modules within existing cognitive agents. We are looking for a Data Science intern to join our team beginning Summer 2019. As a Data Science Intern, you will collaborate with the other software development team members to do meaningful work while also growing your expertise. Strong consideration will be given to candidates who can present a successful project in machine learning that demonstrates the ability to create and train end-to-end solutions combining data preparation, advanced analysis, and useful outputs. Responsibilities include working within an agile development environment with other software developers, a scrum master, and product owners to develop and deliver quality solutions. Specifically, the Data Science intern will perform the following: Research state-of-the-art algorithms in machine learning to identify viable approaches to significant unsolved challenges for Nittany AI Alliance projects. Design solution prototypes that connect data sources through the selected algorithms to a concrete use case. Develop code to implement the algorithms, and test their efficacy and efficiency against real-world data. Requirements: Proficiency with a modern programming language appropriate for machine learning prototyping. Python is required, and skill in another language such as JavaScript or R would be beneficial. Knowledge of data structures and data management methods, and the ability to analyze a problem and determine an efficient structure for the task. As development is performed within an agile/scrum environment, knowledge of continuous build integration and development operations is desired. Ability to communicate technical topics effectively to both technical and nontechnical team members and staff. Ability to read, understand, and apply technical papers and articles in research journals. A self-starter comfortable working in a team environment is a must; therefore, the ability to effectively communicate with product owners and team members and the ability to develop clear written technical documentation, are critical. Preferred: Experience with cloud computing and storage services, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud; specific experience with machine learning and deep learning capabilities on those platforms is preferred. Experience with containerization technologies, particularly Docker and Kubernetes. Experience with machine learning frameworks and libraries, such as TensorFlow, Infer.net, or Caffe. Proficiency in the underlying mathematics of deep learning, particularly linear algebra and multivariate calculus. This is a part-time position working 15-20 hours per week from ASAP after completion of the PSU Spring semester through 8/19/2019. Possibility for internship to extend into Fall semester based on Nittany AI Alliance workload and availability of the candidate.'\",Artificial Intelligence (AI) Data Scientist\n",

      "   \\nZillow is looking for an extraordinary Data Scientist to join a growing team. Zillow is on a mission to give consumers certainty and control when selling their home. In particular, using our unparalleled data, and view into housing markets, to help build a world-class platform for real estate marketplace optimization. In the Zillow Offers product, Zillow buys homes directly from interested homeowners, thereby sparing them the tremendous stress and effort of selling. Instead, we take that upon ourselves by quickly preparing these homes for the market and sell them to buyers. This is a key initiative at Zillow as we aim to define the future of real estate. This product isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t viable for everyone (yet). When that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the case, we want to make sure we still help consumers sell their home.\n",

While our automated A/B testing systems give us a baseline understanding of how features perform, we need creative and curious data scientists who know what it takes to design controlled experiments for a wide range of hypotheses, and who are well versed in statistics.\\n\n",
